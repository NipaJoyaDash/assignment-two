<h1>IT ALL STARTED BACK IN 2009.</h1>

I had just gotten laid off from my online magazine editor job, was having a personal creative-funk-crisis, and was in a total rut. Nothing inspired me until a Saturday afternoon viewing of Julie & Julia changed everything. (Literally everything. I can say that now, many years later, looking back on that fruitful afternoon.)
<br>
I wanted, needed something to get my creative juices flowing everyday. And just like Amy Adams‚Äôs epiphany came by cooking her way through Julia Child‚Äôs cookbook, an ‚Äòah ha‚Äô moment came to me as well. I realized that I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm scouring flea markets, vintage stores and garage sales for the perfect pieces to add to my wardrobe. I love finding vintage goodies that may not fit me perfectly or translate well with the current state of fashion, and then make ‚Äòem work. (üôåTim Gunn!) I ‚ù§ changing hems, cutting sleeves and tweaking pieces to transform something super low-budge that had its moment back in 1976 into something spectacular for today. 
<br>
And with that realization, I decided that for the entire year, I was going to introduce a new piece of clothing into my existing wardrobe found from thrift stores and flea markets on a dollar a day budget. Yep, that‚Äôs when my 365 day challenge began. For 365 days I was only going to spend 365 dollars to make 365 items of clothing. Let‚Äôs just say 2009-2010 was one helluva year!
<br>
It was nuts to see something that I was just doing for myself, to make me feel less crappy, grow into something that was being enjoying by so many more people outside of my mom and dad. (Always gotta love that parental support though!) I was featured by some of my favorite bloggers (A Cup of Jo), some of my favorite magazines (hey, Bust, heeeeeeey), some of my favorite daytime shows (Nate Berkus, we‚Äôll always have Season 1), and I even got a book deal out of it! Random House, thanks for making this girl‚Äôs dream come true.
<br>
I think what it came down to was that NDAD was a place to get inspired, think outside the box on the fashion front, have FUN, and just celebrate creativity. And that first year really solidified what the site is all about still to this day! 
<br>
I‚Äôm not a classically trained sewer but I love to get my DIY on! I‚Äôm a total goofball (*see EVERY ‚Äúbefore‚Äù shot on this site*), obsessed with jasmine scented everything, Rome (and Italy in general), rose gold, Netflix, margaritas, Rihanna, and I never met a dessert I didn‚Äôt like. OK, I‚Äôm just not that into cream cheese icing, but let‚Äôs be honest...that won‚Äôt stop me.
<br>
I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre here and whether you‚Äôre a sewing maven or a complete novice without a lick of craftiness in your soul (PS - everyone‚Äôs got a little crafty in them somewhere!) you‚Äôll have fun on this journey with me, I promise.
